| Bot Quirks - Please Read |
============================
- In order to connect to your browser this bot needs to close your existing browser session, and reopen.

- This bot needs to be ran with "node social.js" every day. Eventually planning on building a bot that sits in the background all the time to run once a day.

- This bot does not sign up, or withdraw from casinos. It only collects the daily login bonuses.

- Luckyland Slots Application is built into a canvas, automatic login is not supported yet. Collection is (Cookies save your login session for weeks). Thus you need to login to luckyland slots before running the bot (first time only).

- "Do you want to save the password on this site" popup breaks the bot. Looking to fix this issue eventually however, in the meantime please make sure this popup does not appear when you log into a site.
